# Simple Shell Project Collaboration

**Project Name:** Simple Shell

**Collaborators:** 
- Edwin Amon
- Enoch BED

## Project Overview

In this collaborative effort, Edwin Amon and Enoch BED have teamed up to create a simple shell as part of their programming project. A shell is a fundamental component of the operating system that allows users to interact with the computer through a command-line interface. This project aims to develop a basic shell that can perform common command-line operations.

## Project Goals

1. **Shell Implementation:** Create a functional shell that can execute basic command-line operations, such as navigating directories, running programs, and managing processes.

2. **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface for the shell that allows users to input commands and receive output effectively.

3. **Command Parsing:** Implement a command parser to interpret and execute user commands.

4. **Directory Navigation:** Enable users to navigate the file system and manage directories and files.

5. **Process Management:** Develop functionality for process creation, management, and termination.

6. **Custom Commands:** Add custom commands and features to enhance the shell's functionality.
